Design and Prototyping Coursework

As a team, we were tasked with designing and prototyping an app that would allow users to buy flowers online.

My role in this project was to deliver visual prototypes based on debated and accepted ideas on the topic. I was also tasked with delivering
the final report as a docx.

I learned proto.io and also had a paid subscription for a month to use all the features.

The prototype has been deleted because I have not continued my subscription, however there is a youtube link where I show it and I explain
how it works.
